Possible Misuse Scenarios of WLRT

Status: active / meta-misuse

Description:
This branch documents common misuse scenarios
and anti-patterns observed or anticipated in WLRT applications.

Topics include:
- interpreting LFI as a buy/sell signal,
- assuming directional causality from WLRT indices,
- cherry-picking WLRT-compatible narratives,
- ignoring applicability limits and data constraints,
- retrofitting WLRT explanations to known outcomes.

The goal is to explicitly identify how WLRT can be misused
and to provide guidance on recognizing and avoiding
such distortions.

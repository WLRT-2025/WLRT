WLRT Safety and Misuse Considerations

Status: active / meta-safety

Description:
This branch addresses safety considerations and potential misuse
of the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- common forms of misinterpretation of WLRT results,
- risks of treating WLRT as a predictive or trading system,
- misuse of LFI as a directional signal,
- overfitting and confirmation bias,
- recommendations for responsible analytical use.

The goal is to explicitly state how WLRT should
and should not be used, reducing the risk of misuse
and misrepresentation.

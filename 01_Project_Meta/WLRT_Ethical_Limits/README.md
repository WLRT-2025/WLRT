Ethical Limits of WLRT

Status: active / meta-ethics

Description:
This branch defines the ethical boundaries
for the development and application of WLRT.

Topics include:
- distinction between analysis and manipulation,
- prohibition of using WLRT to engineer market harm,
- responsibility in public communication of WLRT insights,
- avoidance of false certainty and overclaiming,
- ethical considerations in automated or large-scale use.

The goal is to articulate a clear ethical stance
that governs how WLRT insights may be developed,
communicated, and applied.

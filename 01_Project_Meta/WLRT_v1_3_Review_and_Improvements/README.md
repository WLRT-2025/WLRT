Status: active / meta-version-review

Description:
This branch reviews WLRT version 1.3,
documents its improvements over earlier versions,
and identifies issues that led to subsequent revisions.

Topics include:
- structural changes introduced in v1.3,
- refinements of liquidity concepts,
- early formulation of fragility-related ideas,
- known limitations discovered post-release,
- transition path toward v1.3.1 and v2.x.

The goal is to preserve a clear and accurate
record of WLRT version evolution and rationale.

WLRT Development Plan (Early / Historical)

Status: archived / meta-historical

Description:
This branch contains early planning documents and
conceptual roadmaps created during the initial stages
of WLRT development.

Topics include:
- original versioning ideas,
- early prioritization of research directions,
- abandoned or restructured concepts,
- comparison with later finalized development plans.

The goal is to preserve the historical evolution
of WLRT planning without interfering with
current or future development workflows.

Description:
This branch provides an intuitive and accessible explanation
of liquidity concepts underlying the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- what liquidity is and what it is not,
- why price is not the same as liquidity,
- how liquidity redistributes over time,
- simple analogies for fragility and phase transitions,
- common misconceptions about markets and indicators.

The goal is to make WLRT ideas understandable
without relying on formal mathematics,
while remaining faithful to the core theory.

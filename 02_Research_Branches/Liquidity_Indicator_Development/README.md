Liquidity Indicator Development (WLRT)

Status: active / research (core-support)

Description:
This branch focuses on the development of liquidity-related indicators
within the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- construction principles of WLRT-compatible indicators,
- relationship between indicators and Local Fragility Index (LFI),
- leading vs lagging behavior under WLRT,
- robustness, decay, and reflexivity effects.

The goal is to explore indicator designs that are consistent
with WLRT assumptions and to clarify their limits of applicability.

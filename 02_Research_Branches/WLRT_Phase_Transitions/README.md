WLRT Phase Transitions

Status: active / core-support research

Description:
This branch studies phase transition mechanisms within the WLRT framework.

Focus areas include:
- transition thresholds and triggering conditions,
- the role of Local Fragility Index (LFI),
- reversibility vs irreversibility of transitions,
- pre-transition signals and empirical correlates,
- distinction between true transitions and noise-induced artifacts.

The goal is to formalize how and when WLRT systems move
between phases and how such transitions should be interpreted.

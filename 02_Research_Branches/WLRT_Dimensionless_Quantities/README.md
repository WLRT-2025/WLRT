WLRT Dimensionless Quantities

Status: active / core-support research

Description:
This branch focuses on the construction and interpretation
of dimensionless quantities within the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- normalization principles for liquidity-related measures,
- scale invariance across markets and timeframes,
- relation between dimensionless quantities and LFI,
- comparability of regimes with different units and magnitudes,
- limits of normalization in non-stationary environments.

The goal is to provide a consistent dimensionless layer
supporting WLRT analysis across systems and scales.

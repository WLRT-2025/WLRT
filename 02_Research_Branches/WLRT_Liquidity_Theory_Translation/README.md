WLRT Liquidity Theory Translation

Status: active / meta-translation (theory-canonical)

Description:
This branch focuses on the precise translation of WLRT liquidity theory
across languages, with special attention to conceptual fidelity.

Topics include:
- canonical translations of liquidity-related concepts,
- comparison of English and Russian formulations,
- identification of ambiguous or misleading translations,
- glossary of liquidity theory terms,
- alignment with WLRT canonical statements.

The goal is to preserve the internal logic and meaning
of WLRT liquidity theory across languages,
not merely to translate text verbatim.

Crypto Market Monitoring using WLRT

Status: active / empirical research

Description:
This branch focuses on systematic monitoring of major cryptocurrency
markets using the WLRT framework.

Scope includes:
- BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP and overall crypto market structure,
- tracking Local Fragility Index (LFI) dynamics,
- identification of pre-transition signals,
- comparison across assets and timeframes.

The goal is to establish a consistent WLRT-based monitoring
methodology for crypto markets and to accumulate empirical evidence
supporting or challenging theoretical expectations.

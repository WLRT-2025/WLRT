Cross-System Liquidity Dynamics in WLRT

Status: active / core-support research

Description:
This branch studies liquidity dynamics across interacting systems
within the WLRT framework.

Focus areas include:
- cross-system liquidity transfer,
- stability region mismatches,
- phase misalignment between systems,
- cascading fragility and systemic transitions.

The goal is to understand how local liquidity dynamics
interact at the multi-system level and how fragility
can propagate across coupled markets or subsystems.

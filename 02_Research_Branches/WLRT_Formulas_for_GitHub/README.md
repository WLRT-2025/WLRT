WLRT Formulas for GitHub

Status: active / meta-technical (canonical)

Description:
This branch collects and standardizes the mathematical
formulations used in the WLRT framework for GitHub publication.

Topics include:
- canonical WLRT equations and definitions,
- LaTeX-compatible representations,
- symbol tables and notation conventions,
- consistency checks across WLRT versions,
- mapping between formal expressions and conceptual descriptions.

The goal is to provide a clean, unambiguous,
and reproducible mathematical layer
supporting WLRT documentation and future implementation.

WLRT v1.2 Audit

Status: active / meta-audit

Description:
This branch performs a retrospective audit of WLRT version 1.2.

Topics include:
- internal consistency of definitions and assumptions,
- comparison with later WLRT versions,
- identification of deprecated concepts,
- elements preserved and generalized in newer cores,
- lessons learned for future theoretical development.

The goal is to maintain continuity and rigor
across WLRT versions by explicitly documenting
earlier design choices and their outcomes.

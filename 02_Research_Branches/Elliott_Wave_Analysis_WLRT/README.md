Elliott Wave Theory Analysis through WLRT

Status: active / research (critical comparative)

Description:
This branch provides a formal and critical analysis of
Elliott Wave Theory (EWT) from the perspective of WLRT.

Topics include:
- interpretive ambiguity of wave labeling,
- non-uniqueness of Elliott wave decompositions,
- comparison with WLRT phase logic,
- relation between wave patterns and liquidity redistribution,
- cases where apparent wave structures emerge as artifacts.

The goal is not to reinterpret Elliott Wave Theory,
but to assess its explanatory power and limitations
within a liquidity-based framework.

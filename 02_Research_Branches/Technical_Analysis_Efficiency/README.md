Efficiency of Technical Analysis in WLRT Context

Status: active / research (critical interface)

Description:
This branch examines the effectiveness and limitations of
technical analysis (TA) through the lens of WLRT.

Topics include:
- leading vs lagging indicators under liquidity dynamics,
- pattern emergence as a consequence of liquidity redistribution,
- reflexivity and decay of technical indicators,
- false predictability induced by phase-dependent behavior,
- conditions where TA appears informative without causal power.

The goal is to formally assess when technical analysis
provides actionable information and when it merely
reflects underlying liquidity states captured by WLRT.

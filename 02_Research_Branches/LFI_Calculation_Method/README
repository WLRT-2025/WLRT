# LFI Calculation Methodology

**Branch ID:** 25  
**Status:** active  
**Level:** Research  
**Related Core:** WLRT v3.0  
**Invariant:** LFI (Local Fragility Index)

---

## Purpose

This branch defines a **formal, reproducible methodology** for computing the
**Local Fragility Index (LFI)** within the Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory (WLRT).

The goal is not prediction of price direction, but **quantification of local
instability of the liquidity field** preceding phase transitions.

---

## Scope

This branch covers:
- conceptual definition of LFI;
- observable inputs used for its computation;
- aggregation logic and temporal behavior;
- interpretation of LFI values;
- explicit limitations and misuse boundaries.

This branch does **not** define:
- trading strategies;
- entry/exit rules;
- profit optimization;
- forecasting guarantees.

## Structure

- `LFI_Definition.md` — conceptual definition and meaning of LFI  
- `LFI_Inputs.md` — observable inputs and data requirements  
- `LFI_Computation.md` — step-by-step computation logic  
- `LFI_Interpretation.md` — interpretation of LFI dynamics  
- `Limitations.md` — known limits and failure modes  
- `Examples/` — illustrative examples (optional)

---

## Canonical Rules

- The name **LFI** is fixed and invariant.
- LFI measures **fragility**, not direction.
- Any heuristic or empirical assumption must be explicitly marked.
- Absence of signal ≠ stability guarantee.

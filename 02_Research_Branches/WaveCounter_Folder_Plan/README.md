WaveCounter Folder Plan

Status: active / meta-structure

Description:
This branch defines the directory structure
and folder governance rules of the WaveCounter project.

Topics include:
- top-level folder hierarchy,
- purpose and scope of each directory,
- rules for adding new branches and documents,
- naming conventions and versioning,
- criteria for archival, freezing, or refactoring folders.

The goal is to maintain a scalable, readable,
and logically coherent project structure
as the number of branches grows.

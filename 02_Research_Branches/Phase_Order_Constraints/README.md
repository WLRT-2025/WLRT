Phase Order Constraints in WLRT

Status: active / core-support research

Description:
This branch studies admissible and inadmissible phase orders
in the WLRT framework, including irreversibility conditions,
cycle constraints, and logical boundaries of phase transitions.

The goal is to identify which phase sequences are theoretically
possible, which are forbidden, and which indicate breakdown
or regime change of the WLRT description.

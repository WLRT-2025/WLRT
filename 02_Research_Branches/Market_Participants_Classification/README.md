Market Participants Classification in WLRT

Status: active / research (core-support)

Description:
This branch develops a classification of market participants
within the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- liquidity providers vs liquidity takers,
- reflexive and WLRT-aware agents,
- strategic vs reactive behavior,
- heterogeneity of participant time horizons,
- impact of participant composition on LFI dynamics.

The goal is to link agent-level behavior
to emergent liquidity redistribution patterns
and phase transitions described by WLRT.

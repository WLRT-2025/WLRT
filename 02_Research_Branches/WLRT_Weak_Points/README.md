Weak Points and Limitations of WLRT

Status: active / research (critical core-support)

Description:
This branch systematically documents the known weaknesses,
limitations, and open problems of the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- regimes where WLRT assumptions break down,
- ambiguity in phase identification,
- limits of LFI observability,
- sensitivity to data quality and granularity,
- interaction with reflexive and adversarial behavior.

The goal is not to undermine WLRT,
but to clearly state its boundaries and
to guide responsible use and further development.

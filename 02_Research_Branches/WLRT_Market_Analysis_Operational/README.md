WLRT Market Analysis (Operational)

Status: active / empirical (operational)

Description:
This branch contains short-horizon operational market analyses
conducted using the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- current market state snapshots,
- short-term phase identification,
- near-term fragility assessments,
- operational interpretations of WLRT indices,
- documentation of market reactions to liquidity events.

The goal is to capture transient WLRT-relevant states
without conflating them with long-term empirical conclusions.

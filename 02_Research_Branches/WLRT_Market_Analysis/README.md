WLRT Market Analysis

Status: active / empirical research (supporting)

Description:
This branch provides integrated market analysis using the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- combined interpretation of price, liquidity, and WLRT indices,
- identification of dominant market phases,
- detection of fragility buildup and release,
- comparison across assets and timeframes,
- synthesis of empirical signals into coherent market narratives.

The goal is to produce structured WLRT-based market analyses
that remain consistent with theoretical constraints
and avoid price-centric bias.

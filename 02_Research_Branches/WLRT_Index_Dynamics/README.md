WLRT Index Dynamics

Status: active / research (core-support)

Description:
This branch studies the temporal dynamics of WLRT-related indices.

Topics include:
- evolution of indices over time,
- phase-space representation of index dynamics,
- geodesic-like trajectories in liquidity state space,
- coupling between different WLRT indices,
- stability, hysteresis, and transition dynamics.

The goal is to understand how WLRT indices behave dynamically
and how their trajectories encode information about
fragility growth and phase transitions.

WLRT Index Dynamics (Early Draft)

Status: archived / research (early draft)

Description:
This branch contains early draft materials related to
the dynamics of WLRT indices.

Topics include:
- initial ideas on index evolution,
- preliminary phase-space representations,
- alternative notations and definitions,
- approaches later revised or abandoned.

The goal is to preserve the conceptual development
leading to the canonical WLRT index dynamics,
without mixing early drafts with finalized theory.

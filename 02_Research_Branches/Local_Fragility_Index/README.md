Local Fragility Index (LFI)

Status: active / core-support (foundational)

Description:
This branch focuses on the Local Fragility Index (LFI) as a core concept
of the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- conceptual definition of LFI,
- interpretation of LFI values and dynamics,
- role of LFI in phase transitions,
- relationship between LFI and system stability,
- limits of observability and interpretability of LFI.

This branch does not define the calculation procedure itself
(which is handled separately), but rather the theoretical
meaning, scope, and constraints of the index.

Price and Liquidity Analysis in WLRT

Status: active / empirical research (supporting)

Description:
This branch focuses on the joint analysis of price movements
and liquidity dynamics within the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- separation of price signals from liquidity state variables,
- cases of price movement with minimal liquidity redistribution,
- liquidity shifts preceding observable price changes,
- asymmetric price responses under similar liquidity conditions,
- limitations of price-only interpretations.

The goal is to clarify the role of price as an observable
projection of underlying liquidity redistribution processes.

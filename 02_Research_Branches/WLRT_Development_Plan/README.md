WLRT Development Plan

Status: active / meta-strategy

Description:
This branch defines the development roadmap of the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- version structure and scope (v1.x, v2.x, v3.0, v4.0),
- criteria for version maturity and freeze,
- prioritization of research directions,
- separation between core theory, extensions, and applications,
- conditions for backward compatibility and refactoring.

The goal is to maintain a coherent and controlled evolution
of WLRT as a long-term research program.

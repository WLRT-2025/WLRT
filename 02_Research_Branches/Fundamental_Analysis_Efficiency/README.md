Efficiency of Fundamental Analysis in WLRT Context

Status: active / research (critical interface)

Description:
This branch analyzes the effectiveness and limitations of
fundamental analysis when viewed through the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- interaction between fundamental signals and liquidity dynamics,
- temporal mismatch between fundamentals and market response,
- cases where WLRT-based indicators dominate price formation,
- conditions under which fundamental analysis remains informative,
- interpretive asymmetry between fundamentals and liquidity states.

The goal is not to reject fundamental analysis, but to
clarify its role, limits, and interaction with WLRT-based reasoning.

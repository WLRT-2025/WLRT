WLRT Canonical Statements

Status: active / meta-canonical

Description:
This branch collects concise, strong, and stable statements
that express core ideas of the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- canonical definitions,
- non-trivial but robust claims,
- carefully worded limitations,
- statements resistant to misinterpretation,
- quotable formulations for academic and public use.

The goal is to preserve semantic precision
and ensure consistency of WLRT communication
across documents, versions, and audiences.

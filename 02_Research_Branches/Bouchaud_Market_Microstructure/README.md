Bouchaud’s Market Microstructure and WLRT

Status: active / research (theoretical grounding)

Description:
This branch studies the works of Jean-Philippe Bouchaud
and related market microstructure literature in relation
to the WLRT framework.

Topics include:
- price impact and liquidity depletion,
- long memory in order flow,
- market response asymmetry,
- empirical regularities versus interpretive models,
- points of convergence and divergence with WLRT assumptions.

The goal is to ground WLRT concepts within established
microstructure research while clearly delineating
conceptual differences and extensions.

# WLRT v2.0 — Status Declaration
*(Internal Canonical Draft)*

## Status

WLRT v2.0 is hereby designated as an internal canonical draft.

The theoretical architecture of WLRT v2.0 (Parts I–IV) is complete, internally consistent, and stylistically unified. No further conceptual extensions, structural revisions, or scope expansions are permitted within v2.0.

---

## Scope

WLRT v2.0 extends WLRT v1.x by introducing:
- multilayer liquidity structure;
- interpretive asymmetry under partial observability;
- control and stabilization as structural forcing;
- threshold-driven failure modes, including leverage-induced liquidity release (LILR);
- structural limits of applicability.

WLRT v2.0 does not revise or reinterpret any element of WLRT v1.x.

---

## Permitted Changes

The following changes are permitted within WLRT v2.0:
- editorial refinement;
- stylistic unification;
- formatting and typesetting;
- conversion to publication formats.

The following changes are explicitly prohibited:
- introduction of new theoretical concepts;
- modification of existing definitions;
- addition of empirical content or case studies;
- reinterpretation of architectural decisions.

---

## Relation to Future Versions

All future theoretical development must occur in subsequent versions (e.g., WLRT v2.1, WLRT v3.0) or in separate companion documents.

WLRT v2.0 remains an internal reference point for such developments.

---

## Declaration

This status declaration freezes WLRT v2.0 as an internal canonical theoretical draft.

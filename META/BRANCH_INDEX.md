# 📘 BRANCH_INDEX — WaveCounter / WLRT

**Status:** canonical  
**Scope:** full project  
**Rule:** branches 1–57 are the historical corpus; 58+ are post-canonical extensions

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This file is the single authoritative registry of all WaveCounter / WLRT branches.
It defines their numbering, scope, status, and materialization state.

---

## 🔒 Canonization Rule

- **Branches №1–57**  
  Fixed historical research corpus.  
  May be logical (non-materialized) or physical (materialized).

- **Branches №58+**  
  Explicit, controlled extensions created after canonization.

> **Important:** Branch numbering is canonical and may be non-contiguous.  
> A branch is a unit of knowledge, not necessarily a physical folder.

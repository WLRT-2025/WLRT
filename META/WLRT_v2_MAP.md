# WLRT v2.0 — Canonical Conceptual Map
*(Architectural Summary, Internal)*

---

## Layer 0 — Relation to WLRT v1.x (Foundational Layer)

WLRT v1.x constitutes a closed and frozen foundational layer.  
It defines the field ontology of liquidity, treats price as an emergent observable, and explicitly excludes agent-based, optimization-based, and empirical calibration assumptions.

WLRT v2.0 does not revise, reinterpret, or amend any element of WLRT v1.x.  
All extensions in v2.0 operate strictly on top of the foundational layer.

## Part I — Extended Liquidity State Space  
*(What exists)*

**Core idea:**  
Liquidity is a multilayer structure rather than a homogeneous field.

### Structural components:
- spot liquidity as a local and high-frequency layer;
- derivative-induced liquidity as a source of synthetic depth;
- synthetic and cross-market liquidity across instruments and venues;
- institutional and long-horizon liquidity layers;
- explicit temporal hierarchy of layers.

### Structural mechanism:
- **Leverage-Induced Liquidity Release (LILR)**:
  - accumulation of latent pressure in leveraged derivative positions;
  - threshold-driven, nonlinear release of pressure;
  - formulated as a structural hypothesis, neither universal nor always dominant;
  - a central source of impulse-driven instability in leveraged markets.

**Function of Part I:**  
Defines the ontology of the extended liquidity state space.

## Part II — Observability and Interpretation  
*(What can be observed and how interpretation fails)*

**Core idea:**  
Observable market data are projections of the liquidity field, not direct measurements.

### Structural elements:
- partial and asymmetric observability;
- data as projections rather than state variables;
- liquidity, volatility, and stability illusions.

### Central concept:
- **Interpretive Asymmetry**:
  - arises even under equal access to observable data;
  - results from ontological mismatch rather than informational scarcity.

### Limiting regime:
- **Minimal-Information Agent (MIA)**:
  - an abstract boundary case with access only to basic price and volume data;
  - demonstrates the minimal advantage of WLRT:
    - exclusion of logically inconsistent interpretations
    - without additional data or computation.

**Function of Part II:**  
Defines constraints on admissible interpretations under partial observability.

---

## Part III — Control, Stabilization, and Failure Modes  
*(How dynamics unfold)*

**Core idea:**  
Control and stabilization are structural interventions, not guarantees of stability.

### Structural elements:
- control as external structural forcing;
- stabilization as suppression of observable fluctuations;
- accumulation of latent deformations;
- temporal lags and inter-layer asynchrony.

### Failure mechanisms:
- depletion of spot liquidity;
- inter-layer cascades;
- **LILR as an impulse-driven failure mechanism**.

### Link to interpretation:
- interpretive asymmetry explains the perceived suddenness of failures;
- absence of observable signals does not imply absence of structural tension.

**Function of Part III:**  
Describes regime failures and phase transitions in multilayer liquidity systems.

---

## Part IV — Market Archetypes and Applicability  
*(Where and when WLRT applies)*

**Core idea:**  
WLRT v2.0 is structurally applicable, not universal.

### Structural elements:
- typology of markets by liquidity-layer composition;
- role of derivatives and leverage;
- dominance regimes of different layers;
- conditions of applicability and non-applicability.

**Function of Part IV:**  
Limits generalization and prevents misapplication of the theory.

---

## Central Structural Links

- **Part I → Part II**:  
  Multilayer structure implies intrinsic non-observability.

- **Part II → Part III**:  
  Interpretive errors explain the apparent suddenness of failures.

- **LILR**:  
  Connects derivative layers (Part I), interpretive blindness (Part II),  
  and impulse-driven regime failures (Part III).

---

## Status

- architecture is closed and internally consistent;
- no empirical assumptions are required;
- ready for selective textual development.

---

## Fixed Decisions

- WLRT v1.x is frozen and canonical;
- WLRT v2.0 architecture is complete;
- core innovations:
  - multilayer liquidity,
  - interpretive asymmetry,
  - LILR as a threshold instability mechanism.

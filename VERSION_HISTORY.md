# WLRT — Version History and Semantic Roles

This document describes the historical evolution of the Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory (WLRT),
clarifying the semantic role of each version family.

WLRT versions form a **hierarchically complementary structure**, not a sequence of mutually exclusive
or deprecated theories. Later versions do not invalidate earlier ones; instead, they organize,
constrain, and formalize their scope.

## Overview of Version Families

| Version family | Primary role | Status |
|----------------|-------------|--------|
| v1.x | Phenomenological foundation | Historical / conceptual |
| v2.x | Operational and empirical access | Auxiliary / non-canonical |
| v3.0 | Ontological and logical canon | Canonical / frozen |

## WLRT v1.x — Phenomenological Foundation

**Versions:**  
v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, v1.3, v1.3.1, v1.x

**Role:**  
WLRT v1.x provides the **phenomenological and observational foundation** of the theory.

These versions introduced:
- early descriptions of liquidity-driven market behavior,
- qualitative patterns and regime intuition,
- empirical observations motivating later formalization,
- conceptual language preceding strict ontology.

v1.x versions remain meaningful as:
- levels of observation,
- empirical entry points,
- sources of intuition and hypothesis generation.

They are **not canonical definitions** of WLRT, but they retain historical and interpretative value.

## WLRT v2.x — Operational and Empirical Structure

**Versions:**  
v2.0, v2.1

**Role:**  
WLRT v2.x provides an **operational and empirically accessible layer**.

These versions introduced:
- operational heuristics,
- applied monitoring logic,
- empirical workflows and indicators,
- early algorithmic interpretations of fragility and transitions.

v2.x enables *use* of WLRT concepts but does not define their ultimate meaning.

Important clarifications:
- v2.x is **not an alternative ontology** to v3.0,
- v2.x is **not superseded**, but **constrained** by v3.0,
- v2.x remains auxiliary and non-canonical.

v2.x exists to bridge observation and application, not to define theory.

## WLRT v3.0 — Canonical Ontology and Logic

**Version:**  
v3.0

**Status:**  
**Canonical, frozen**

**Role:**  
WLRT v3.0 defines the **ontological, logical, and structural core** of the theory.

It establishes:
- what entities exist within WLRT,
- which transitions are admissible or forbidden,
- the irreversibility of certain phase transitions,
- the formal role of fragility, stability, and observability limits.

WLRT v3.0 is:
- the **only canonical definition** of WLRT,
- the sole reference for citation and theoretical consistency,
- the version intended for academic publication and archival (SSRN, arXiv, Zenodo).

No new definitions may appear outside WLRT v3.0.
Any future development must proceed via **WLRT v4.0** or later versions.

---

## Complementarity Principle

WLRT versions are **hierarchically complementary**, not mutually exclusive:

- v1.x provides phenomenology,
- v2.x provides operational structure and empirical access,
- v3.0 provides ontological and logical coherence.

Earlier versions are not invalidated; their roles are **organized and limited** by later versions.

## Notes on Repository Structure

This repository may reference earlier versions for historical or contextual purposes.
However:
- only WLRT v3.0 holds canonical status,
- auxiliary materials do not redefine the theory,
- future extensions will occur only in subsequent major versions.

WLRT Index Dynamics (Empirical)

Status: active / empirical (core-support)

Description:
This branch documents empirical observations of WLRT index dynamics
across assets, timeframes, and market conditions.

Topics include:
- time-series behavior of WLRT indices,
- phase transitions observed in data,
- correlation and decoupling from price movements,
- empirical patterns preceding instability,
- validation and stress-testing of theoretical expectations.

The goal is to assess how WLRT indices behave in practice
and to identify stable empirical regularities and limitations.

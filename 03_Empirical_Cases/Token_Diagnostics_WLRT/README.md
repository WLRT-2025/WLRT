WLRT Token Diagnostics

Status: active / empirical application

Description:
This branch contains WLRT-based diagnostic analyses
of individual crypto tokens and assets.

Topics include:
- application of WLRT indices to specific tokens,
- comparative diagnostics across multiple assets,
- detection of fragility buildup and release,
- interpretation of liquidity redistribution patterns,
- documentation of empirical case studies.

The goal is to demonstrate how WLRT can be applied
to real assets without altering the theoretical core.

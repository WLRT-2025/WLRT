WLRT Canonical Statement

Status: active / core-canonical

Statement:
Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory (WLRT) describes
market dynamics as the evolution and redistribution
of liquidity fields under structural constraints.

WLRT does not model prices as primary causal variables.
Observed price movements are treated as projections
of underlying liquidity redistribution processes.

The Local Fragility Index (LFI) measures proximity
to instability and phase transition, not direction
or magnitude of price change.

WLRT is an analytical framework, not a forecasting tool.
Its validity depends on liquidity observability
and structural coherence of the analyzed system.

Scope:
WLRT applies to sufficiently liquid markets and
does not claim universality across all economic systems.

Limits of Applicability of WLRT

Status: active / core-adjacent (applicability)

Description:
This branch defines the conditions under which
the WLRT framework is applicable and where it is not.

Topics include:
- minimum liquidity observability requirements,
- market structures incompatible with WLRT assumptions,
- regimes dominated by exogenous controls or fixed pricing,
- limitations under extreme illiquidity or discrete trading,
- distinction between analytical insight and predictive use.

The goal is to clearly delineate the valid domain
of WLRT and prevent misuse outside its theoretical scope.

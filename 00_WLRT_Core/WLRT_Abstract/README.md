WLRT Abstract

Status: active / core-abstract

Description:
Wave Liquidity Redistribution Theory (WLRT) is a framework
for analyzing market dynamics through the redistribution
of liquidity rather than price-centric patterns.

WLRT models markets as evolving liquidity fields and
introduces the Local Fragility Index (LFI) to detect
early loss of stability preceding phase transitions.

The theory emphasizes non-causal informational signals,
asymmetric responses, and structural constraints on
market evolution.

WLRT is applicable to financial markets with sufficient
liquidity observability and is not intended as a
price-prediction model.
